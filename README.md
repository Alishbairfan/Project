# Project

The goal of this project is to build a complete end-to-end system for predicting air quality (AQI) in Karachi, combining real-time data ingestion, feature engineering, machinelearning modeling, automated pipelines, and a web-based dashboard. The system predicts both next-hour AQI and 3-day average AQI, with color-coded alerts for hazardous levels.
